					<p>Over the past decade, the DNA laboratory in the office of New 
York City’s chief medical examiner emerged as a pioneer in analyzing the
 most complicated evidence from crime scenes. It developed two 
techniques, which went beyond standard practice at the FBI and other 
public labs, for making identifications from DNA samples that were tiny 
or that contained a mix of more than one person’s genetic material.</p>

<p>As its reputation spread, the lab processed DNA evidence supplied not
 only by the New York police, but also by about 50 jurisdictions as far 
away as Bozeman, Montana, and Floresville, Texas, which paid the lab 
$1,100 per sample.</p>

<p>Now these DNA analysis methods are under the microscope, with 
scientists questioning their validity, ProPublica has found. In court 
testimony, a former lab official said she was fired for criticizing one 
method, and a former member of the New York State Commission on Forensic
 Science said he had been wrong when he approved their use. The first 
expert witness allowed by a judge to examine the software source code 
behind one technique recently concluded that its accuracy “should be 
seriously questioned.”</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the lab shelved the two methods and replaced them with newer, more broadly used technology.</p>

<p>A coalition of defense lawyers is asking the New York State inspector
 general’s office — the designated watchdog for the state’s crime labs —
 to launch an inquiry into the use of the disputed analysis methods in 
thousands of criminal cases. While the inspector general has no 
jurisdiction over the court system, any finding of flaws with the DNA 
analysis could prompt an avalanche of litigation. Previous convictions 
could be revisited if the flawed evidence can be shown to have made a 
difference in the outcome.</p>

<p>The medical examiner’s office “has engaged in negligent conduct that 
undermines the integrity of its forensic DNA testing and analysis,” the 
Legal Aid Society and the Federal Defenders of New York wrote the 
inspector general on Friday. Because the lab has kept problems with its 
“unreliable” testing and “unsound statistical evidence” secret from the 
public and the courts, they continued, “innocent people may be wrongly 
convicted, and people guilty of serious crimes may go free.”</p>

<p>In addition to those convicted using the disputed methods, many 
defendants may have chosen to plead guilty when they learned prosecutors
 had DNA evidence against them. Their cases face significant barriers to
 reconsideration.</p>

<p>The medical examiner’s office stands by its science. Its chief of 
laboratories, Timothy Kupferschmid, said that the discarded techniques 
were well-tested and valid, and that the lab was adopting newer methods 
to align with changing FBI standards. He compared it to a vehicle 
upgrade.</p>

<p>“So just because we’re switching to the new model, I mean, our old 
pickup truck worked great, but my new pickup truck is so much better,” 
he said.</p>

<p>One case that hinges on the disputed DNA techniques stemmed from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/nyregion/brooklyn-man-recalls-2013-beating-and-his-pleas-for-help.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=EndOfArticle&amp;pgtype=article">beating of Taj Patterson in December 2013</a>.
 A group of Hasidic men attacked Patterson, a black student, in the 
Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Prosecutors blamed the attack on the 
Shomrim, a Hasidic group that patrols Williamsburg, a neighborhood where
 tensions between Orthodox Jews and blacks have long simmered.</p>

<p>Six days after the attack, the police found one of Patterson’s black Air Jordan sneakers on a nearby roof.</p>

<p>The police sent the sneaker to the DNA lab, where a technician 
swabbed a 3-inch by 6-inch area of its heel — and recovered 97.9 
picograms of DNA from at least two people. A picogram is one trillionth 
of a gram.</p>

<p>The sample bore Patterson’s DNA. Using software developed in-house, 
the lab calculated that it was 133 times more likely than not that the 
remainder belonged to Mayer Herskovic, a young father who lived and 
worked in Williamsburg and had no criminal record.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that this is DNA,” Herskovic told ProPublica. “A 
mixture, like you take milk, orange juice and water and you mix it, what
 is it? Is it still milk? Is it still orange juice? I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“DNA is the magic word,” he added. “If you throw it into a trial, they eat it up. For me, it’s not magic at all.”</p>

    <p>No other physical evidence linked Herskovic to the attack on 
Patterson, who was blinded in his right eye. Neither the victim nor 
those who witnessed the crime identified Herskovic at trial, nor was he 
seen on surveillance video. Herskovic said he has never been part of the
 Shomrim, and deplored the assault on Patterson.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/nyregion/mayer-herskovic-gang-assault-taj-patterson.html">was convicted by a judge of gang assault</a>, and sentenced this past March to four years in prison. He is appealing.</p>

<p>Three years ago, Barry Scheck, a co-founder of the Innocence Project,
 a nonprofit that uses DNA evidence to exonerate wrongly convicted 
prisoners, yelled at his colleagues on the state forensic commission 
about the potential perils of the DNA work at the city’s lab.</p>

<p>“The day of reckoning is going to come,” Scheck told his fellow 
commissioners, some of whom rolled their eyes, a video of the meeting 
showed. “Someday people are going to review this,” he continued. “It’s 
an Ebola. It is a cancer here that could be spreading. We are all on 
notice.”</p>

<hr>

<p>For three decades, forensic DNA evidence has been a valuable tool in 
criminal investigations, incriminating or exonerating suspects. Matching
 a defendant’s genetic material with a sample found on a weapon or at a 
crime scene has proved extremely persuasive with judges and juries.</p>

<p>But not all DNA evidence is equal. Sometimes it’s clear: blood or 
semen identifies a single person. If it’s just a few skin cells left on 
an object, or if it contains more than one person’s genetic material, it
 can be more ambiguous. In such situations, labs used to report that the
 results were inconclusive, or the defendant could not be excluded from 
the mix.</p>

<p>New types of DNA analysis have been introduced in recent years to 
interpret trace amounts or complex mixtures, spawning an industry of 
testing tools, chemical kits and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/where-traditional-dna-testing-fails-algorithms-take-over">software</a>. As analysis has become more complex, the techniques and results are coming under fire nationwide.</p>

<p>In the past three years, flaws in DNA methods have temporarily shut down testing in public crime labs in <a href="http://www.mystatesman.com/news/austin-police-dna-lab-closed-amid-forensics-commission-concerns/rjbYwEnkci0IVy7LAPXVnM/">Austin, Texas</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/national-accreditation-board-suspends-all-dna-testing-at-district-lab/2015/04/26/2da43d9a-ec24-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html?utm_term=.76ed1f771e37">Washington, D.C.</a>
 Lab analysts “make it seem like it’s a completely objective process,” 
said Bicka Barlow, a lawyer in California with a master’s degree in 
genetics and molecular biology. “But I’m 100 percent convinced that 
there are many people who are incarcerated who were convicted with DNA 
evidence who are innocent.”</p>

<p>The two techniques that New York’s lab introduced were the 
“high-sensitivity testing” of trace DNA amounts, and the Forensic 
Statistical Tool, or FST, in which software calculates the likelihood 
that a suspect’s genetic material is present in a complicated mixture of
 several people’s DNA. By its own estimate, the lab has used 
high-sensitivity DNA testing to analyze evidence samples in 3,450 cases 
over the past 11 years, and FST in 1,350 cases over the past six. Cases 
in which both methods were used may be counted in both totals.</p>

    <p>In February 2012, responding to a 911 call about gunshots near 
East Tremont Avenue, police officers from the 45th Precinct in the Bronx
 saw a passer-by make a motion as if he was dropping an object under a 
parked car.</p>

<p>His was a familiar face: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/defendant-involved-bronx-shooting-sentenced-seven-years-prison-illegally-possessing">Johnny Morgan</a>,
 who had been arrested 75 times. The police found a .40-caliber Glock 23
 beneath the car. Morgan was charged with gun possession, based both on 
DNA evidence and witness testimony. But the amount of DNA recovered from
 the gun was extremely small; the lab initially said it was unsuitable 
for testing.</p>

<p>After the prosecutor and the police requested a high-sensitivity test, analysts said Morgan’s DNA was a match. He was convicted.</p>

<p>Public crime labs assessing DNA evidence, including the FBI’s lab, 
“amplify,” or copy, the material 28 times to conduct their analysis. 
Under the high-sensitivity testing method developed by Theresa Caragine,
 a forensic scientist, and implemented in 2006, New York’s lab began to 
push very small amounts through three more cycles, bringing the total to
 31. This approach provided more material to look at — as much as eight 
times the standard approach. But, like turning up the volume on a radio,
 those additional cycles amplified small imperfections from missing or 
contaminated DNA.</p>

<p>To reduce potential problems, the lab decided not to amplify samples 
smaller than 20 picograms, or about three cells’ worth of DNA, its 
then-director, Mechthild Prinz, said in 2005 during the state’s approval
 process for the test. She declined to comment for this article.</p>

<p>“The scientific community has been asked to test more and more 
evidence with less and less amounts of DNA,” Prinz explained in 2009 to 
the DNA Subcommittee of the state forensic science commission, which 
approves all forensic methods used in New York State.</p>

    <p>“A couple of years ago, DNA testing was limited to body fluids — 
semen, blood and saliva. Now every laboratory in the country routinely 
receives swabs from guns,” other weapons, burglary tools and cash 
registers, she said.</p>

<p>After several years of high-sensitivity testing of small amounts of 
DNA, the lab developed a second method: a piece of software to interpret
 complex mixtures.</p>

<p>Invented by Caragine and Adele Mitchell, a geneticist with a 
specialty in statistics who joined the lab in 2008, the Forensic 
Statistical Tool, or FST, considers the overall amount of DNA in the 
mixture, how many people are in it, how much information is probably 
missing or contaminated, and the frequency with which each piece of DNA 
appears in different racial or ethnic groups. Then it compares the 
defendant’s DNA profile to the mixture, and calculates a likelihood 
ratio, which it expresses as a single number.</p>

<p>The bigger that number — and it’s sometimes in the millions or even 
trillions — the more likely that the defendant’s DNA is present. 
Caragine and Mitchell testified in 2012 that about a third of all test 
results were favorable to defendants, by indicating that their DNA was 
probably absent.</p>

<p>Only a small proportion of cases using the Forensic Statistical Tool 
went to trial. Most defendants faced with unfavorable FST results 
pleaded guilty, defense lawyers say. “Just the prospect of those numbers
 going in front of the jury could really warp the plea bargaining 
process,” said Brad Maurer, a lawyer and DNA specialist at New York 
County Defender Services.</p>

<p>Eric Rosenbaum, an assistant district attorney and head of the DNA 
Prosecutions Unit in Queens, described FST as an “extremely powerful 
tool because it is devastating in court.”</p>

    <p>In December 2012, The New York Times profiled Mitchell and Caragine in the article “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/nyregion/a-forensic-tool-helps-decide-guilt-or-innocence.html">Helping Decide Guilt or Innocence</a>,”
 which described their fruitful collaboration, but also hinted at a 
brewing controversy. The Legal Aid Society was gearing up for an 
extensive fight against admission of FST results in court.</p>

<p>One interested reader was Eli Shapiro, the former mitochondrial DNA 
technical leader in the DNA lab. One reason for his early retirement, he
 later testified, was the stress over having to sign off on lab reports 
generated by the software. Even in the lab, few people knew the science 
behind it.</p>

<p>Shapiro later said in court that he found the FST process described 
in the article “very disturbing.” He reached out to his former boss and 
colleagues to express his alarm. “They were not concerned,” he 
testified.</p>

<p>So, in early 2013, Shapiro offered his help to Legal Aid, which had 
just formed a unit specializing in DNA evidence. Under a judge’s order, 
the lab had given Legal Aid the results of its validation studies — 
internal tests of FST’s accuracy. Shapiro helped decipher the data.</p>

<p>“He knows the math,” said Clinton Hughes, a Legal Aid lawyer. “For 
relaxation, he does long division on the beach with a pencil.”</p>

<p>From 2012 to 2014, a hearing in Brooklyn before Judge Mark Dwyer 
focused on DNA evidence in two cases: it had been recovered from the 
handlebars of a bicycle after a shooting, and from the clothing of a 
sexual assault victim. With the help of testimony from Shapiro and some 
of the world’s most renowned DNA experts, Legal Aid hoped to persuade 
the judge to throw out the evidence.</p>

<p>The defense experts were denied access to FST’s software code, which 
would later come under scrutiny. Instead, they criticized the way that 
Caragine and Mitchell designed and tested FST.</p>

<p>Bruce Budowle, an architect of the FBI’s national DNA database, 
testified that New York’s statistical methods were “not defensible.”</p>

<p>He said that FST was designed with the incorrect assumption that 
every DNA mixture of the same size was missing information or had been 
contaminated in just the same way. He also criticized the lab’s 
overreliance on “pristine” saliva and samples to test its methods, which
 do not mirror the ways real crime-scene evidence is degraded by time 
and weather. The lab underestimated the challenges, he testified.</p>

<p>“Five-person mixtures can look like three-person,” he said, “four 
contributors can look like two-person mixtures. It’s almost impossible 
to actually be accurate.”</p>

 building up private DNA databases, in part by collecting voluntary 
samples from people not charged with — or even suspected of — any

    <p>The software’s inventors acknowledged a margin of error of 30 
percent in their method of quantifying the amount of DNA in a sample, a 
key input into the FST calculation. They acknowledged that FST didn’t 
consider that different people in a mixture, especially family members, 
might share DNA.</p>

<p>In April 2013, weeks after testifying, Caragine was forced to resign 
from the lab after New York’s inspector general found that she had 
violated protocol by changing her colleagues’ FST results in two cases. 
Her defense was that she was correcting their mistakes. Mitchell left in
 2014. Caragine declined to comment for this article, and Mitchell did 
not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most dramatic testimony in the hearing came from Ranajit 
Chakraborty, who had developed the FBI’s policy on DNA in the 1990s and,
 as a member of New York’s DNA Subcommittee, voted to approve both 
high-sensitivity testing in 2005 and FST in 2010. What he had since 
learned about FST bothered him.</p>

<p>“What would your vote be today?” Jessica Goldthwaite, a lawyer for Legal Aid, asked Chakraborty on the stand.</p>

<p>“My answer would be no,” he said. In November 2014, Judge Dwyer sided
 with the defense, excluding evidence produced by both high-sensitivity 
testing and FST. He was the first state judge to do so, and so far the 
only one.</p>

<hr>

<p>Appointed to the state forensic science commission when it formed in 
1994, Scheck didn’t vote for either of the lab’s methods. His misgivings
 grew when he learned that the DNA sample used to convict Morgan in the 
Bronx gun case was only 14.15 picograms. That was below the 20-picogram 
minimum for high-sensitivity testing the lab had promised to set during 
its approval process back in 2005.</p>

<p>At the October 2014 commission meeting, Scheck pounded the table as 
he proposed to compel the lab to turn over any validation studies it had
 conducted for high-sensitivity testing of especially small samples. He 
accused lab officials of not having performed the necessary studies, 
despite their assurances otherwise. While Scheck’s motion failed, it 
drew a vote from an unexpected supporter: Marina Stajic, who then worked
 for the medical examiner’s office as the director of the toxicology 
lab. She supported the motion, she later testified, because she believed
 that the DNA lab should be transparent with its data.</p>

<p>Her boss, Dr. Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner, heard 
about Stajic’s vote the next morning. She expressed her anger in an 
email to a colleague, “Hold me down.”</p>

<p>Mimi Mairs, then a lawyer for the DNA lab, emailed, “She sucks.”</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the medical examiner’s office declined to comment 
on the correspondence, as did the Manhattan district attorney’s office, 
where Mairs is now a prosecutor.</p>

<p>In April 2015, Dr. Sampson and Kupferschmid fired Stajic, who had 
worked at the lab for 29 years. Kupferschmid then called a commission 
member to inquire whether Stajic would also be removed from the 
oversight group, according to court documents.</p>

<p>In February 2016, Stajic sued Dr. Sampson, Kupferschmid and the city 
for allegedly violating her First Amendment rights. The defendants’ 
lawyer contends Stajic can’t prove why she was fired, and that her vote 
wasn’t constitutionally protected speech. Her case is pending.</p>

    <p>The case that finally revealed FST’s source code began with a few drops of cooking oil.</p>

<p>Kevin Johnson and his ex-girlfriend Octaviea Martin shared custody of
 two sons, and he sometimes stayed over in her Bronx apartment. One 
night in April 2015, he was cooking cheeseburgers when some oil spilled.
 He and Martin argued about cleaning it up.</p>

<p>Her daughter got upset and called 911, telling the dispatcher that 
Johnson was pointing a gun at Martin. A police search of the apartment 
turned up two socks wedged between the refrigerator and the wall. In one
 sock was a black pistol; in the other, a silver revolver.</p>

<p>Johnson, who had been convicted on a previous weapons charge, was arrested.</p>

<p>The lab found that one gun contained two people’s DNA; by FST’s 
calculation, it was 156 times more likely than not to contain Johnson’s 
DNA. The second gun had three people’s DNA and a formidable likelihood 
of 66 million.</p>

<p>Hoping to cast doubt on the DNA results, his lawyers, Christopher 
Flood and Sylvie Levine, asked for the FST source code, which other 
lawyers had sought in vain.</p>

<p>Again, the government refused to hand it over on the grounds that it 
was a “proprietary and copyrighted” statistical tool owned by the City 
of New York.</p>

<p>The federal judge granted the defense access to the FST code in June 
2016 under an order that bars wider disclosure. (The medical examiner’s 
office denied ProPublica’s public records request for the code, citing 
its “sensitive nature.”)</p>

<p>Nathaniel Adams, a computer scientist and an engineer at a private 
forensics consulting firm in Ohio, reviewed the code for the defense. He
 found that the program dropped valuable data from its calculations, in 
ways that users wouldn’t necessarily be aware of, but that could 
unpredictably affect the likelihood assigned to the defendant’s DNA 
being in the mixture.</p>

<p>“I did not leave with the impression that FST was developed by an 
experienced software development team,” Adams wrote in an affidavit. 
Pending more rigorous testing, “the correctness of the behavior of the 
FST software should be seriously questioned.” Characterizing Adams’ 
criticisms as merely stylistic rather than substantive, the lab told 
ProPublica that FST provided reliable calculations.</p>

<p>Technology consultants wrote the software code for FST, according to a
 spokeswoman at the medical examiner’s office. Few, if anyone, at the 
lab or on the state’s DNA Subcommittee had the expertise to double-check
 the software, said a scientist in the lab who worked on the techniques 
who asked to remain anonymous for fear of career repercussions. “We 
don’t know what’s going on in that black box, and that is a legitimate 
question,” the scientist said, adding that evidence in older cases 
should “absolutely” be retested in light of growing questions about FST.
 “As a scientist, I can’t say no.”</p>

    <p>The U.S. attorney’s office withdrew the DNA evidence against 
Johnson days before the hearing about its admissibility was scheduled to
 begin.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Johnson pleaded guilty this past May. On Aug. 28, he 
was sentenced to 28 months in prison, almost all of which he has already
 served. His lawyers declined to make him available for an interview.</p>

<p>As Johnson’s case proceeded, the lab circulated a memo to clients in 
September 2016, notifying them that it would replace both 
high-sensitivity testing and FST on Jan. 1. A new chemical kit would 
make the additional amplification cycles of the high-sensitivity method 
unnecessary. The lab would retire FST in favor of STRmix, a commercially
 available and <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/05/prweb14341692.htm">FBI-endorsed</a> software program for DNA mixtures that <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/17/07/p9824090/two-more-cases-affirm-use-reliability-of-strmix">dozens</a> of public labs use.</p>

<p>The medical examiner’s office “is fully committed to staying on the 
cutting edge of new technology to best serve the City of New York,” 
Kupferschmid wrote in the memo. He added that the lab would raise the 
minimum sample size for testing to 37.5 picograms — almost twice the 
initial floor of 20 picograms.</p>

<hr>

<p>The change in policy is scant consolation to those who were convicted
 based on the discarded DNA techniques, like Mayer Herskovic. After the 
gang attack on Patterson, two confidential informants gave Herskovic’s 
name to a police detective. Herskovic was then arrested and swabbed for 
DNA. Neither informant testified against him at trial.</p>

<p>Sitting at a table in his apartment in Williamsburg, Herskovic 
discussed the DNA evidence, first calmly and then indignantly. The white
 walls were bare except for a small mirror, a clock and a portrait of 
his children, who were scribbling in coloring books on the kitchen 
floor. He recalled how, when the police asked him to give a DNA sample, 
his lawyer cautioned him not to, but Herskovic went ahead and did so.</p>

<p>“I was the first one to give DNA,” Herskovic said. “He told me they needed it, I said, ‘Go ahead, take it! It will be better.’”</p>

<p>The DNA on Patterson’s sneaker was pivotal to the case against 
Herskovic. Patterson testified that whoever pulled off his shoe had 
punched and kicked him. Although four other suspects were arrested, and 
several other men were identified by witnesses, seen on surveillance 
video, or had their license plates photographed at the scene, only 
Herskovic has been tried or sentenced to prison. Two people pleaded 
guilty to misdemeanors and were given probation; charges were dropped 
against the other two.</p>

<p>Herskovic’s four-year sentence was stayed pending appeal. He’s 
working at an hourly job for a heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
 company to support his wife and two young children. His appeals lawyer,
 Donna Aldea, plans to argue that FST was never tested on a population 
as insulated as the Hasidic Jews of Williamsburg, who very likely share 
many of the same ancestors, and therefore much of the same DNA.</p>

<p>“This case is a poster-child for how ‘DNA evidence’ can literally be 
fabricated out of thin air, and how statistics can be manipulated to 
create a false impression of ‘scientific evidence’ of guilt,” Aldea 
said. “This must be exposed.”</p>

        <textarea readonly="readonly">&lt;h1&gt;Thousands of Criminal 
Cases in New York Relied on Disputed DNA Testing 
Techniques&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the DNA 
laboratory in the office of New York City’s chief medical examiner 
emerged as a pioneer in analyzing the most complicated evidence from 
crime scenes. It developed two techniques, which went beyond standard 
practice at the FBI and other public labs, for making identifications 
from DNA samples that were tiny or that contained a mix of more than one
 person’s genetic material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As its reputation spread, 
the lab processed DNA evidence supplied not only by the New York police,
 but also by about 50 jurisdictions as far away as Bozeman, Montana, and
 Floresville, Texas, which paid the lab $1,100 per 
sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now these DNA analysis methods are under the 
microscope, with scientists questioning their validity, ProPublica has 
found. In court testimony, a former lab official said she was fired for 
criticizing one method, and a former member of the New York State 
Commission on Forensic Science said he had been wrong when he approved 
their use. The first expert witness allowed by a judge to examine the 
software source code behind one technique recently concluded that its 
accuracy “should be seriously questioned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier 
this year, the lab shelved the two methods and replaced them with newer,
 more broadly used technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coalition of defense 
lawyers is asking the New York State inspector general’s office — the 
designated watchdog for the state’s crime labs — to launch an inquiry 
into the use of the disputed analysis methods in thousands of criminal 
cases. While the inspector general has no jurisdiction over the court 
system, any finding of flaws with the DNA analysis could prompt an 
avalanche of litigation. Previous convictions could be revisited if the 
flawed evidence can be shown to have made a difference in the 
outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical examiner’s office “has engaged in
 negligent conduct that undermines the integrity of its forensic DNA 
testing and analysis,” the Legal Aid Society and the Federal Defenders 
of New York wrote the inspector general on Friday. Because the lab has 
kept problems with its “unreliable” testing and “unsound statistical 
evidence” secret from the public and the courts, they continued, 
“innocent people may be wrongly convicted, and people guilty of serious 
crimes may go free.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to those convicted 
using the disputed methods, many defendants may have chosen to plead 
guilty when they learned prosecutors had DNA evidence against them. 
Their cases face significant barriers to 
reconsideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical examiner’s office stands 
by its science. Its chief of laboratories, Timothy Kupferschmid, said 
that the discarded techniques were well-tested and valid, and that the 
lab was adopting newer methods to align with changing FBI standards. He 
compared it to a vehicle upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So just because 
we’re switching to the new model, I mean, our old pickup truck worked 
great, but my new pickup truck is so much better,” he 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One case that hinges on the disputed DNA 
techniques stemmed from the &lt;a 
href=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/nyregion/brooklyn-man-recalls-2013-beating-and-his-pleas-for-help.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=EndOfArticle&amp;pgtype=article&gt;beating
 of Taj Patterson in December 2013&lt;/a&gt;. A group of Hasidic men 
attacked Patterson, a black student, in the Williamsburg section of 
Brooklyn. Prosecutors blamed the attack on the Shomrim, a Hasidic group 
that patrols Williamsburg, a neighborhood where tensions between 
Orthodox Jews and blacks have long simmered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six days 
after the attack, the police found one of Patterson’s black Air Jordan 
sneakers on a nearby roof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police sent the sneaker
 to the DNA lab, where a technician swabbed a 3-inch by 6-inch area of 
its heel — and recovered 97.9 picograms of DNA from at least two people.
 A picogram is one trillionth of a gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample 
bore Patterson’s DNA. Using software developed in-house, the lab 
calculated that it was 133 times more likely than not that the remainder
 belonged to Mayer Herskovic, a young father who lived and worked in 
Williamsburg and had no criminal record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t 
believe that this is DNA,” Herskovic told ProPublica. “A mixture, like 
you take milk, orange juice and water and you mix it, what is it? Is it 
still milk? Is it still orange juice? I don’t 
know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DNA is the magic word,” he added. “If you 
throw it into a trial, they eat it up. For me, it’s not magic at 
all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other physical evidence linked Herskovic to 
the attack on Patterson, who was blinded in his right eye. Neither the 
victim nor those who witnessed the crime identified Herskovic at trial, 
nor was he seen on surveillance video. Herskovic said he has never been 
part of the Shomrim, and deplored the assault on 
Patterson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, he &lt;a 
href=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/nyregion/mayer-herskovic-gang-assault-taj-patterson.html&gt;was
 convicted by a judge of gang assault&lt;/a&gt;, and sentenced this past
 March to four years in prison. He is appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three
 years ago, Barry Scheck, a co-founder of the Innocence Project, a 
nonprofit that uses DNA evidence to exonerate wrongly convicted 
prisoners, yelled at his colleagues on the state forensic commission 
about the potential perils of the DNA work at the city’s 
lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The day of reckoning is going to come,” Scheck 
told his fellow commissioners, some of whom rolled their eyes, a video 
of the meeting showed. “Someday people are going to review this,” he 
continued. “It’s an Ebola. It is a cancer here that could be spreading. 
We are all on notice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three decades, forensic DNA
 evidence has been a valuable tool in criminal investigations, 
incriminating or exonerating suspects. Matching a defendant’s genetic 
material with a sample found on a weapon or at a crime scene has proved 
extremely persuasive with judges and juries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not 
all DNA evidence is equal. Sometimes it’s clear: blood or semen 
identifies a single person. If it’s just a few skin cells left on an 
object, or if it contains more than one person’s genetic material, it 
can be more ambiguous. In such situations, labs used to report that the 
results were inconclusive, or the defendant could not be excluded from 
the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New types of DNA analysis have been 
introduced in recent years to interpret trace amounts or complex 
mixtures, spawning an industry of testing tools, chemical kits and &lt;a
 
href=https://www.propublica.org/article/where-traditional-dna-testing-fails-algorithms-take-over&gt;software&lt;/a&gt;.
 As analysis has become more complex, the techniques and results are 
coming under fire nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past three years,
 flaws in DNA methods have temporarily shut down testing in public crime
 labs in &lt;a 
href=http://www.mystatesman.com/news/austin-police-dna-lab-closed-amid-forensics-commission-concerns/rjbYwEnkci0IVy7LAPXVnM/&gt;Austin,
 Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a 
href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/national-accreditation-board-suspends-all-dna-testing-at-district-lab/2015/04/26/2da43d9a-ec24-11e4-a55f-38924fca94f9_story.html?utm_term=.76ed1f771e37&gt;Washington,
 D.C.&lt;/a&gt; Lab analysts “make it seem like it’s a completely 
objective process,” said Bicka Barlow, a lawyer in California with a 
master’s degree in genetics and molecular biology. “But I’m 100 percent 
convinced that there are many people who are incarcerated who were 
convicted with DNA evidence who are innocent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two
 techniques that New York’s lab introduced were the “high-sensitivity 
testing” of trace DNA amounts, and the Forensic Statistical Tool, or 
FST, in which software calculates the likelihood that a suspect’s 
genetic material is present in a complicated mixture of several people’s
 DNA. By its own estimate, the lab has used high-sensitivity DNA testing
 to analyze evidence samples in 3,450 cases over the past 11 years, and 
FST in 1,350 cases over the past six. Cases in which both methods were 
used may be counted in both totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2012, 
responding to a 911 call about gunshots near East Tremont Avenue, police
 officers from the 45th Precinct in the Bronx saw a passer-by make a 
motion as if he was dropping an object under a parked 
car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His was a familiar face: &lt;a 
href=https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/defendant-involved-bronx-shooting-sentenced-seven-years-prison-illegally-possessing&gt;Johnny
 Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, who had been arrested 75 times. The police found a 
.40-caliber Glock 23 beneath the car. Morgan was charged with gun 
possession, based both on DNA evidence and witness testimony. But the 
amount of DNA recovered from the gun was extremely small; the lab 
initially said it was unsuitable for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 
the prosecutor and the police requested a high-sensitivity test, 
analysts said Morgan’s DNA was a match. He was 
convicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public crime labs assessing DNA evidence, 
including the FBI’s lab, “amplify,” or copy, the material 28 times to 
conduct their analysis. Under the high-sensitivity testing method 
developed by Theresa Caragine, a forensic scientist, and implemented in 
2006, New York’s lab began to push very small amounts through three more
 cycles, bringing the total to 31. This approach provided more material 
to look at — as much as eight times the standard approach. But, like 
turning up the volume on a radio, those additional cycles amplified 
small imperfections from missing or contaminated 
DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce potential problems, the lab decided not
 to amplify samples smaller than 20 picograms, or about three cells’ 
worth of DNA, its then-director, Mechthild Prinz, said in 2005 during 
the state’s approval process for the test. She declined to comment for 
this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The scientific community has been asked
 to test more and more evidence with less and less amounts of DNA,” 
Prinz explained in 2009 to the DNA Subcommittee of the state forensic 
science commission, which approves all forensic methods used in New York
 State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A couple of years ago, DNA testing was 
limited to body fluids — semen, blood and saliva. Now every laboratory 
in the country routinely receives swabs from guns,” other weapons, 
burglary tools and cash registers, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 
several years of high-sensitivity testing of small amounts of DNA, the 
lab developed a second method: a piece of software to interpret complex 
mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invented by Caragine and Adele Mitchell, a 
geneticist with a specialty in statistics who joined the lab in 2008, 
the Forensic Statistical Tool, or FST, considers the overall amount of 
DNA in the mixture, how many people are in it, how much information is 
probably missing or contaminated, and the frequency with which each 
piece of DNA appears in different racial or ethnic groups. Then it 
compares the defendant’s DNA profile to the mixture, and calculates a 
likelihood ratio, which it expresses as a single 
number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger that number — and it’s sometimes in
 the millions or even trillions — the more likely that the defendant’s 
DNA is present. Caragine and Mitchell testified in 2012 that about a 
third of all test results were favorable to defendants, by indicating 
that their DNA was probably absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small 
proportion of cases using the Forensic Statistical Tool went to trial. 
Most defendants faced with unfavorable FST results pleaded guilty, 
defense lawyers say. “Just the prospect of those numbers going in front 
of the jury could really warp the plea bargaining process,” said Brad 
Maurer, a lawyer and DNA specialist at New York County Defender 
Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Rosenbaum, an assistant district 
attorney and head of the DNA Prosecutions Unit in Queens, described FST 
as an “extremely powerful tool because it is devastating in 
court.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2012, The New York Times profiled 
Mitchell and Caragine in the article “&lt;a 
href=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/nyregion/a-forensic-tool-helps-decide-guilt-or-innocence.html&gt;Helping
 Decide Guilt or Innocence&lt;/a&gt;,” which described their fruitful 
collaboration, but also hinted at a brewing controversy. The Legal Aid 
Society was gearing up for an extensive fight against admission of FST 
results in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One interested reader was Eli 
Shapiro, the former mitochondrial DNA technical leader in the DNA lab. 
One reason for his early retirement, he later testified, was the stress 
over having to sign off on lab reports generated by the software. Even 
in the lab, few people knew the science behind 
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shapiro later said in court that he found the FST 
process described in the article “very disturbing.” He reached out to 
his former boss and colleagues to express his alarm. “They were not 
concerned,” he testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in early 2013, Shapiro 
offered his help to Legal Aid, which had just formed a unit specializing
 in DNA evidence. Under a judge’s order, the lab had given Legal Aid the
 results of its validation studies — internal tests of FST’s accuracy. 
Shapiro helped decipher the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He knows the math,”
 said Clinton Hughes, a Legal Aid lawyer. “For relaxation, he does long 
division on the beach with a pencil.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2012 to 
2014, a hearing in Brooklyn before Judge Mark Dwyer focused on DNA 
evidence in two cases: it had been recovered from the handlebars of a 
bicycle after a shooting, and from the clothing of a sexual assault 
victim. With the help of testimony from Shapiro and some of the world’s 
most renowned DNA experts, Legal Aid hoped to persuade the judge to 
throw out the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defense experts were 
denied access to FST’s software code, which would later come under 
scrutiny. Instead, they criticized the way that Caragine and Mitchell 
designed and tested FST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Budowle, an architect 
of the FBI’s national DNA database, testified that New York’s 
statistical methods were “not defensible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said 
that FST was designed with the incorrect assumption that every DNA 
mixture of the same size was missing information or had been 
contaminated in just the same way. He also criticized the lab’s 
overreliance on “pristine” saliva and samples to test its methods, which
 do not mirror the ways real crime-scene evidence is degraded by time 
and weather. The lab underestimated the challenges, he 
testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five-person mixtures can look like 
three-person,” he said, “four contributors can look like two-person 
mixtures. It’s almost impossible to actually be 
accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software’s inventors acknowledged a 
margin of error of 30 percent in their method of quantifying the amount 
of DNA in a sample, a key input into the FST calculation. They 
acknowledged that FST didn’t consider that different people in a 
mixture, especially family members, might share 
DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2013, weeks after testifying, Caragine 
was forced to resign from the lab after New York’s inspector general 
found that she had violated protocol by changing her colleagues’ FST 
results in two cases. Her defense was that she was correcting their 
mistakes. Mitchell left in 2014. Caragine declined to comment for this 
article, and Mitchell did not respond to repeated requests for 
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most dramatic testimony in the 
hearing came from Ranajit Chakraborty, who had developed the FBI’s 
policy on DNA in the 1990s and, as a member of New York’s DNA 
Subcommittee, voted to approve both high-sensitivity testing in 2005 and
 FST in 2010. What he had since learned about FST bothered 
him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What would your vote be today?” Jessica 
Goldthwaite, a lawyer for Legal Aid, asked Chakraborty on the 
stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My answer would be no,” he said. In November 
2014, Judge Dwyer sided with the defense, excluding evidence produced by
 both high-sensitivity testing and FST. He was the first state judge to 
do so, and so far the only one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appointed to the state
 forensic science commission when it formed in 1994, Scheck didn’t vote 
for either of the lab’s methods. His misgivings grew when he learned 
that the DNA sample used to convict Morgan in the Bronx gun case was 
only 14.15 picograms. That was below the 20-picogram minimum for 
high-sensitivity testing the lab had promised to set during its approval
 process back in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the October 2014 commission 
meeting, Scheck pounded the table as he proposed to compel the lab to 
turn over any validation studies it had conducted for high-sensitivity 
testing of especially small samples. He accused lab officials of not 
having performed the necessary studies, despite their assurances 
otherwise. While Scheck’s motion failed, it drew a vote from an 
unexpected supporter: Marina Stajic, who then worked for the medical 
examiner’s office as the director of the toxicology lab. She supported 
the motion, she later testified, because she believed that the DNA lab 
should be transparent with its data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her boss, Dr. 
Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner, heard about Stajic’s vote 
the next morning. She expressed her anger in an email to a colleague, 
“Hold me down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mimi Mairs, then a lawyer for the DNA 
lab, emailed, “She sucks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the 
medical examiner’s office declined to comment on the correspondence, as 
did the Manhattan district attorney’s office, where Mairs is now a 
prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2015, Dr. Sampson and 
Kupferschmid fired Stajic, who had worked at the lab for 29 years. 
Kupferschmid then called a commission member to inquire whether Stajic 
would also be removed from the oversight group, according to court 
documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2016, Stajic sued Dr. Sampson, 
Kupferschmid and the city for allegedly violating her First Amendment 
rights. The defendants’ lawyer contends Stajic can’t prove why she was 
fired, and that her vote wasn’t constitutionally protected speech. Her 
case is pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case that finally revealed FST’s 
source code began with a few drops of cooking 
oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Johnson and his ex-girlfriend Octaviea 
Martin shared custody of two sons, and he sometimes stayed over in her 
Bronx apartment. One night in April 2015, he was cooking cheeseburgers 
when some oil spilled. He and Martin argued about cleaning it 
up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her daughter got upset and called 911, telling the
 dispatcher that Johnson was pointing a gun at Martin. A police search 
of the apartment turned up two socks wedged between the refrigerator and
 the wall. In one sock was a black pistol; in the other, a silver 
revolver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson, who had been convicted on a 
previous weapons charge, was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab found 
that one gun contained two people’s DNA; by FST’s calculation, it was 
156 times more likely than not to contain Johnson’s DNA. The second gun 
had three people’s DNA and a formidable likelihood of 66 
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoping to cast doubt on the DNA results, his 
lawyers, Christopher Flood and Sylvie Levine, asked for the FST source 
code, which other lawyers had sought in vain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, 
the government refused to hand it over on the grounds that it was a 
“proprietary and copyrighted” statistical tool owned by the City of New 
York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal judge granted the defense access to 
the FST code in June 2016 under an order that bars wider disclosure. 
(The medical examiner’s office denied ProPublica’s public records 
request for the code, citing its “sensitive 
nature.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathaniel Adams, a computer scientist and an
 engineer at a private forensics consulting firm in Ohio, reviewed the 
code for the defense. He found that the program dropped valuable data 
from its calculations, in ways that users wouldn’t necessarily be aware 
of, but that could unpredictably affect the likelihood assigned to the 
defendant’s DNA being in the mixture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I did not leave
 with the impression that FST was developed by an experienced software 
development team,” Adams wrote in an affidavit. Pending more rigorous 
testing, “the correctness of the behavior of the FST software should be 
seriously questioned.” Characterizing Adams’ criticisms as merely 
stylistic rather than substantive, the lab told ProPublica that FST 
provided reliable calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology consultants
 wrote the software code for FST, according to a spokeswoman at the 
medical examiner’s office. Few, if anyone, at the lab or on the state’s 
DNA Subcommittee had the expertise to double-check the software, said a 
scientist in the lab who worked on the techniques who asked to remain 
anonymous for fear of career repercussions. “We don’t know what’s going 
on in that black box, and that is a legitimate question,” the scientist 
said, adding that evidence in older cases should “absolutely” be 
retested in light of growing questions about FST. “As a scientist, I 
can’t say no.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. attorney’s office withdrew the
 DNA evidence against Johnson days before the hearing about its 
admissibility was scheduled to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, 
Johnson pleaded guilty this past May. On Aug. 28, he was sentenced to 28
 months in prison, almost all of which he has already served. His 
lawyers declined to make him available for an 
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Johnson’s case proceeded, the lab 
circulated a memo to clients in September 2016, notifying them that it 
would replace both high-sensitivity testing and FST on Jan. 1. A new 
chemical kit would make the additional amplification cycles of the 
high-sensitivity method unnecessary. The lab would retire FST in favor 
of STRmix, a commercially available and &lt;a 
href=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2017/05/prweb14341692.htm&gt;FBI-endorsed&lt;/a&gt;
 software program for DNA mixtures that &lt;a 
href=https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/17/07/p9824090/two-more-cases-affirm-use-reliability-of-strmix&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt;
 of public labs use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical examiner’s office “is
 fully committed to staying on the cutting edge of new technology to 
best serve the City of New York,” Kupferschmid wrote in the memo. He 
added that the lab would raise the minimum sample size for testing to 
37.5 picograms — almost twice the initial floor of 20 
picograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change in policy is scant consolation 
to those who were convicted based on the discarded DNA techniques, like 
Mayer Herskovic. After the gang attack on Patterson, two confidential 
informants gave Herskovic’s name to a police detective. Herskovic was 
then arrested and swabbed for DNA. Neither informant testified against 
him at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting at a table in his apartment in 
Williamsburg, Herskovic discussed the DNA evidence, first calmly and 
then indignantly. The white walls were bare except for a small mirror, a
 clock and a portrait of his children, who were scribbling in coloring 
books on the kitchen floor. He recalled how, when the police asked him 
to give a DNA sample, his lawyer cautioned him not to, but Herskovic 
went ahead and did so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was the first one to give 
DNA,” Herskovic said. “He told me they needed it, I said, ‘Go ahead, 
take it! It will be better.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA on Patterson’s 
sneaker was pivotal to the case against Herskovic. Patterson testified 
that whoever pulled off his shoe had punched and kicked him. Although 
four other suspects were arrested, and several other men were identified
 by witnesses, seen on surveillance video, or had their license plates 
photographed at the scene, only Herskovic has been tried or sentenced to
 prison. Two people pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and were given 
probation; charges were dropped against the other 
two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herskovic’s four-year sentence was stayed pending
 appeal. He’s working at an hourly job for a heating, ventilating and 
air-conditioning company to support his wife and two young children. His
 appeals lawyer, Donna Aldea, plans to argue that FST was never tested 
on a population as insulated as the Hasidic Jews of Williamsburg, who 
very likely share many of the same ancestors, and therefore much of the 
same DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This case is a poster-child for how ‘DNA 
evidence’ can literally be fabricated out of thin air, and how 
statistics can be manipulated to create a false impression of 
‘scientific evidence’ of guilt,” Aldea said. “This must be 
exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProPublica is a
