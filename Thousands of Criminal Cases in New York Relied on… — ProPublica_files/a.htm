This action could not\nconceivably have affected the murder rate since when the murder rate\nwas lower, illegal immigration was at a negligible level and the new\ninflux has been prevented from contributing to it.\n\nYou are citing\nflagrant non sequiturs in desperate attempt to justify an obscenely\nhigh rate of incarceration in the USA which was caused by the \u201cwar\non drugs\u201d started, by the government\u2019s own admission, for the\nexplicit purpose of creating a tool that could be used selectively\nagainst blacks and liberals *1 (I.e: for the purpose of political\noppression, NOT for crime control)\n\nAnd ignoring a vast\nbody of literature conclusively showing that the high level of\nincarceration in the USA is accomplishing nothing (despite the\nravings of delusion politicians the statistics show that the crime\nrate is DOWN and that that drop started BEFORE the increase in\nincarceration which was started for the purpose of repressing\npolitical dissent and opposition (as clearly evidenced by classifying\nvideotaping (even from public roads!) of factory farms as\n\u201cterrorism\u201d, attempting to get 70-80 years sentences (effectively\nLIFE, even for teenagers) for peaceful non violent demonstrators who\nwere FULLY COMPLYING WITH ALL POLICE INSTRUCTIONS \u2013 which is only\none small step away (death sentences) from literally as repressive as\nit could possibly get).\n\nWhat makes it\nindisputable that your attempt at deceit is fully intentional is that\nyou overlook something that no one who had investigated the issues to\nany degree whatsoever could conceivably have missed> AUSTRALIA\nBANNED GUNS and the marked decrease in murders (AND suicides) was\nindisputably a direct consequence of that.\n\n*1  John Erlichman\n(Nixon administration) \u201c  \u201cThe Nixon campaign in 1968, and the\nNixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and\nblack people. You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn't\nmake it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting\nthe public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with\nheroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those\ncommunities.

 article is troubling.  How come the financial interests of the 
journalist's sources are hidden from the readers.  Barry Scheck -- in 
addition to his work with the Innocence Project and with the NYS 
Forensic Science Commission -- has a private law firm that has made. and
 stands to continue to make, millions of dollars resulting from his work
 on the Forensic Science Commission.  Eli Shapiro is not an impartial 
scientist.  He is a salaried employee with the Legal Aid Society whose 
financial livelihood is tied to his opinions,  Shapiro has also admitted
 under oath that he doesn't understand the science underlying modern day
 DNA analysis and he has issued DNA reports purporting to mimic NYC 
OCME's analysis that he has admitted were wrong.  Going to Shapiro for 
his opinion on this topic is the equivalent of seek a second opinion on 
open heart surgery from a dermatologist. Dr. Chakraborty's opinion only 
changed once he started working for a laboratory run by a man -- the 
same man who signed Chakraborty's checks -- who disliked FST.  Why were 
these financial interests hidden from the reading audience?  The author 
could have reached the same endpoint while allowing the public to 
properly gauge the motivations and reliability of the reporter's 
sources.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-4" data-action="upvote" title="" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">4</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1lxj68w"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3502893920"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-3503096908"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/ThomtheDoubter/" data-action="profile" data-username="ThomtheDoubter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="177648614" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/ThomtheDoubter/" data-action="profile" data-username="ThomtheDoubter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/thousands-of-criminal-cases-in-new-york-relied-on-disputed-dna-testing-techniques#comment-3502893920" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> John</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/thousands-of-criminal-cases-in-new-york-relied-on-disputed-dna-testing-techniques#comment-3503096908" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Tuesday, September 5, 2017 11:16 AM">7 months ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Interesting background.

 wasn't trying to defend our justice system.  I like facts and I like 
full disclosure.  Articles that gloss over material information to reach
 a desired endpoint because it's ideologically convenient inevitably do a
 disservice to the issue at hand.  Science -- whether it be 
cigarette-cancer studies, climate change studies, and on, and on -- have
 been  and will continue to be distorted in the public forum.  Going 
back to Sacco and Vanzetti and the Lindbergh baby case, forensic 
sciences have long been mischaracterized in courtrooms, and poses a 
heightened risk in criminal courts where a person's liberty is in play. 
 To my mind, serious questions remain in the Queens jogger case.  The 
DNA evidence doesn't make sense to me in light of the facts underlying 
the murder.  Going back to the issue at hand, this article rests on 
logical fallacies, presenting supposition as fact.  Scientific methods 
are continuously improved and replaced.  This does not mean that prior 
methods were "shelved" or inaccurate.  When PCR came on the scene that 
didn't invalidate all the RFLP testing that came before it.  Left 
unexplained in the article was that the NYC DNA labs use of LCN testing 
has now been adopted by laboratories across the United States and 
internationally.  New DNA testing kits no longer strictly adhere to 28 
amplification cycles.  These kits make recommendations and provide that 
individual laboratories should conduct their own validation studies to 
determine what amplification cycles yield reliable results.  Thus, it's 
not that the NYC DNA lab shelved their LCN testing, it's that the rest 
of the DNA community caught up with their methodologies.  The criminal 
justice system is flawed -- as are all systems designed by and reliant 
upon human beings -- and is deserving of continued attention and 
reevaluation.  We do, after all, need a criminal justice system.  This 
reporting, in which relevant facts are hidden from the audience demeans 
the marketplace of ideas and contributes to the toxic tribalistic civic 
discussions in which it's Fox News v. MSNBC and NY Times v. Breitbart.  
People aren't stupid.  Report the truth -- the whole truth -- and let 
them reach their own conclusions.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see

 have a profoundly disturbing strong tendency to take their TV shows 
very literally even when they are beyond satire.    There are probably a
 number of reasons for this -</p><p>Television (as with all other media 
in the USA) is not merely biased (as all media, including European TV 
are) but focused like a laser on maximum dissemination of extreme 
disinformation almost entirely warped in the same general direction.</p><p>Americans
 are educated in a system that severely inhibits the development of 
critical thinking ability whereas European education fosters it.   One 
reliable indication of the profound difference is that at all levels 
American schools use mainly multiple choice tests while in Europe the 
general rule is essay type tests which require far better understand of 
the material.   Multiple choice tests, especially when used exclusively 
as they often are in the USA tend strongly to promote just memorization 
of detail without any attempt at understanding.   Student in the USA 
don't develop critical thinking skills like automatic monitoring for 
inconsistencies, identifying relationships and important exceptions, 
etc.  And, to a government and ruling elite so focused on deception that
 has to be considered a good thing.</p><p>All of the differences (and 
more) are IMHO direct and inevitable effects of having founded a 
culture, society and government from the very beginning with the economy
 being almost totally dependent on the practice of slavery.  Justifying 
such atrocious practices requires a very high level of self delusion by 
the oppressors, who try to impose their delusions on the oppressed.   
When the practice of slavery was officially ended, it continued in all 
but name only for a full century while the toxic attitudes and practices

class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>There is a<br>consistent pattern of gross misrepresentation of the accuracy and<br>validity of forensic testing alleged to be scientific. There have<br>been cases where no validation at all was done, where the validation<br>done was grossly inadequate and where the validation was so deeply<br>flawed that it validated tests that upon appropriate validation were<br>proved to be utterly worthless.</p><p>One notorious<br>example was in arson where observations and tested claimed to be<br>reliable indications of arson were later shown to be present in fires<br>not caused by arson.</p><p>It's bad enough when<br>such tests are used as supporting evidence in cases where there is<br>other good evidence of guilt. But such later proven worthless tests<br>have been used to convict not only in the total absence of any other<br>evidence of guilt at all, but even in cases, even capital cases,<br>where there not only was no other evidence of guilt but abundant<br>evidence of innocence. On the sole grounds that the allegedly<br>"scientific" evidence was "unimpeachable" the<br>evidence of innocence was ignored and innocent people have been<br>executed FOR CRIMES THAT WERE NEVER ACTUALLY COMMITTED AT ALL much<br>less by the defendant.   The inescapable conclusion is that the USA<br>“justice” system is so totally corrupt that district attorneys,<br>prosecutors and police have no concern for innocence at all.  The<br>prevailing attitude is that “they’re probably guilty of something<br>else anyway, so we need to get them behind bars any way we can.”  <br>To that end they routinely withhold exonerating evidence which the<br>law requires them to hand over to the defense and even when caught<br>there are no consequences.  Police routinely lie on the witness<br>stand, “lose” exonerating evidence, fabricate evidence,  throw<br>down planted drugs and/or weapons to assure conviction of those they<br>delude themselves that their “instincts” tell them are guilty,<br>and make it a standard policy to “shoot first and ask questions<br>later – and if need be, plant a weapon and/or drugs on the victim<br>to justify their actions.</p><p>It’s no wonder<br>that the USA has, by a massive margin, the highest per capita rate of<br>incarceration in the entire world.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

 article reinforces many of the issues surrounding the reliance of 
software to determine guilt or innocence, software used to predict 
crime, software used to predict a suspect's threat level and the 
increasing reliance on software developed by private entities.  Too may 
times, our judiciary allows evidence to be used without understanding 
the underlying science.  And in cases where commercially owned software 
is used, defenses will rarely if ever will see underlying code to 
determine its validity.  Even the government will prevent defenses from 
seeing the underlying code for their own software.  It's been widely 
proven that forensics science is junk science.  Things like bite marks, 
hair samples and tire tracks have all been determined to be unreliable, 
yet judges still allow this evidence to be used against suspects.  Why? 
 Because people believe the things the see on shows like CSI and believe
 that science is irrefutable and prosecutors can more easily get 
convictions.  We need to get back (if we were even there) to the point 
where the deck is stacked against the prosecution.  It shouldn't ever be
 easy to convict a citizen...we've made it too easy.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see more</a></div><footer class="comment__footer"><menu class="comment-footer__menu"><li class="voting" data-role="voting"><div><a href="#" class="vote-up  count-0" data-action="upvote" title="Vote up" name="Vote up"><span class="updatable count" data-role="likes">0</span> <span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow-2"></i></span></a> <a href="#" role="button" class="vote-down  count-0" data-action="downvote" title="Vote down" name="Vote down"><span class="control"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-arrow"></i></span></a></div></li><li class="bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</li><li class="comment__share"><a class="toggle" tabindex="0"><span class="text">Share ›</span></a><ul class="comment-share__buttons"><li class="twitter"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:twitter">Twitter</button></li><li class="facebook"><button class="share__button" data-action="share:facebook">Facebook</button></li><li class="link"><input class="share__button" name="Link" title="Click to copy post link" data-action="copy-link" readonly="readonly" value="http://disq.us/p/1m4ynwz"></li></ul></li><li class="realtime" data-role="realtime-notification:3515373971"><span style="display: none;" class="realtime-replies"></span><a style="display: none;" href="#" class="realtime-button"></a></li></menu></footer></div><div data-role="blacklist-form"></div><div data-role="flagging-form"></div><div class="reply-form-container" data-role="reply-form"></div></div><ul data-role="children" class="children"><li class="post" id="post-3515497914"><div role="alert"></div><div data-role="post-content" class="post-content" tabindex="0"><div class="indicator"></div><ul class="post-menu dropdown" data-role="menu"><li class="collapse"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Collapse" name="Collapse"><span>−</span></a></li><li class="expand"><a href="#" data-action="collapse" title="Expand" name="Collapse"><span>+</span></a></li><li class="" role="menuitem"><a class="dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-action="flag" data-role="flag" title="Flag as inappropriate"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icon icon-flag"></i></a></li></ul><div class="avatar hovercard"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/RSmith85/" data-action="profile" data-username="RSmith85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="user"><img data-role="user-avatar" data-user="145940887" src="a_data/noavatar92.png" alt="Avatar"></a></div><div class="post-body"><header class="comment__header"><span class="post-byline"><span> <span class="author publisher-anchor-color"><a href="https://disqus.com/by/RSmith85/" data-action="profile" data-username="RSmith85" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J Smith</a></span> </span><span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/thousands-of-criminal-cases-in-new-york-relied-on-disputed-dna-testing-techniques#comment-3515373971" class="parent-link" data-role="parent-link"><i aria-label="in reply to" class="icon-forward" title="in reply to"></i> ahaz</a></span></span> <span class="post-meta"><span class="bullet time-ago-bullet" aria-hidden="true">•</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/thousands-of-criminal-cases-in-new-york-relied-on-disputed-dna-testing-techniques#comment-3515497914" data-role="relative-time" class="time-ago" title="Wednesday, September 13, 2017 10:30 AM">7 months ago</a></span> </header><div class="post-body-inner"><div class="post-message-container" data-role="message-container"><div class="publisher-anchor-color" data-role="message-content"><div class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>Those are all used in Europe.
